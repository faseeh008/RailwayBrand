â¢ Auth.js with email + password
â¢ Database sessions (PostgreSQL) â no JWT
â¢ Protected routes (dashboard and any user-only pages)
â¢ Profile management (view & update)
â¢ Admin role & dashboard:

â Basic user analytics/statistics
â Admin controls (e.g., role change/disable)

â¢ PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
â¢ Proper use of drizzle.config.ts
â¢ Use Drizzle Studio (no PGAdmin)

3.3 Â± OAuth & Email Flows
â¢ OAuth: Google & GitHub sign-in
â¢ Email verification during signup
â¢ Password reset via secure email link

3.4 Ã AI Chat Interface
â¢ Vercel AI SDK with Gemini API Key
â¢ SvelteKit + TailwindCSS chat UI
â¢ Must handle: user input, response display, loading states, errors
â¢ Encapsulate logic into reusable modules/components

4 Source Control & Workflow (Required)

â¢ Branching: Work on feature/{short-name} branches. No direct commits to main.
â¢ Pull Requests: Open PRs to main. At least one peer review within the group.
â¢ Commit Quality: Working commits only. No broken builds. Use Conventional Com-
mits (feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:).

â¢ Commit Frequency: Small, incremental commits (Ë 5â15 changes per commit) with clear
messages.

â¢ README & .env.example: Keep up-to-date with every PR if setup changes.

5 Fresh-Clone Validation (Required)

Your repo must pass a clean setup by a new developer without manual fixes. Reviewers will:

1. Clone fresh on a new machine/environment.

2. Run cp .env.example .env and fill only required secrets.

3. Run pnpm db:start (Postgres).

4. Run pnpm install, pnpm db:push, then pnpm dev.

6 Extensions

If you finish early, pick one extension to implement:
â¢ Streaming: Stream AI responses instead of returning them all at once.
â¢ Database Chat Storage: Save chat history per user in PostgreSQL.

2â Super Extension
â¢ Tree-Structured Chat History: Store chat messages in a tree format so users can fork a
conversation from any message.

â¢ Admin dashboard with role management & analytics
â¢ OAuth (Google & GitHub), email verification, password reset

7.2 Â§ Repository
â¢ Public GitHub repo with CI passing badge

8 Success Criteria

â All required features implemented (none omitted)
â Passing CI on every PR and on main
â Fresh-clone validation succeeds without manual intervention
â Extensions implemented if possible
â Clear source control hygiene and working commits
â README enables any dev to run the project quickly

Aim for production-readiness: correctness, reliability, and ease of setup. Ask questions on
Slack early.
